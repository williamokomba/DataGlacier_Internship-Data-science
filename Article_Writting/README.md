# Article Writing

#### Model overfitting and underfitting


Time to show off your expertise ;)

Audience: Keep in mind that your audience does not know anything about the selected topic hence explain in such a way that it should be easy to understand even for a non technical person ( You can take any example to explain the concept)

Task:

1. Pick any topic of your interest

2. Choose Platform (Medium/Linkedin/Kaggle) to publish your article.

3. Following structure you can use : Define the problem statement, technical stack (Python/Pandas/Sklearn etc),    

    Steps to be followed (with code if required), conclusion and References (citation).

4. Read, revise and repeat until you feel it's perfect to publish

5. There is no time constraint for this task. If you want to take 4-5 week then take that time but you should do  

     this with perfection.
