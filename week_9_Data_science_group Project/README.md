Github Repo link

Data cleansing and transformation done on the data.

Try at least 2 techniques to clean the data ( for NA values : mean/median/mode/Model based approach to handle NA value/WOE and like this try different techniques to identify and handle outliers as well)

for NLP try different featurization technique and also clean the data using regex and python

Each member should code and review peers work. (Review comment should be present in the github repo)

Each team member should work on different data cleansing approach.

Note:

If one team member is using mean to impute values then other member should experiment on segmented approach or any other model based approach to impute the null values.

you are allowed to merge the code of each individual and work together to get good result.

Make sure code of each team member is placed at provided URL (single repository for whole team)
